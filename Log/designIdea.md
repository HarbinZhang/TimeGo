### About the choices of event

Just now, I find it may be bad to provide only 5 choices to users.("study", "entertain", "sleep", "trash", "exercise")
There are different people want to use it having different attitude. Some want to track things in detail: like eating, shopping, transportation. And others want to track things in the abstract: useful, value, necessary.

So, may be I should provide different mode for people to track their time.

And how to implement this function in a little package is a challenge.  




### About the basic choices for human activities.

Today, One thing annoying me a lot. That is: Do I need to implement "More" option in add_records, such as: transportation, shop, body wash.. 
The answer I think is : NO!

The reason is simple: This app is for recording and analysing how long a person spent on sleep, study, exercise. So we don't need to care about the details about shopping etc.

So, the basic choices are: 
Study, Entertain, Sleep, Exercise, Trash.

PS: and I need to think about  "study" or "work", "exercise" or "sport".
