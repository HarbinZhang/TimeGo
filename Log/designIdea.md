### About the basic choices for human activities.
08/12/2017
Today, One thing annoying me a lot. That is: Do I need to implement "More" option in add_records, such as: transportation, shop, body wash.. 
The answer I think is : NO!

The reason is simple: This app is for recording and analysing how long a person spent on sleep, study, exercise. So we don't need to care about the details about shopping etc.

So, the basic choices are: 
Study, Entertain, Sleep, Exercise, Trash.

PS: and I need to think about  "study" or "work", "exercise" or "sport".
